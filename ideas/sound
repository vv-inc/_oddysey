i think it would be interesting to make
a set of different "sounds emotions" or
something, which would be tracks that all
share a common structure and can be combined
programatically, things like tension or
fear when you're in a dangerous situation,
adrenaline in a battle, inspiration or
"elavation" when doing something cool like
flying fast, and so on.



these are some cool albums or artists
that make things that might be cool in a
space game
