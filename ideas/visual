it would be nice for space to
have a "texture" to it, but some
how procedurally generate that

i was thinking a really "low-tec"
visual would be great, anything
pre-2000s, but also was imagining
floating around in a ship in 3d.
saw this vr version of duck hunt,
and found the perfect in-between.

it would also be great for navigation
around the ship to really feel like
you're grasping for things in a space
you really can't control. like outer-
space actually is, but with a "pov"
feel. i thought that could be done
by allowing one control for head move-
ment, and then display the names of
keys/buttons on things you can grab.

the computers, although the
interface itself should be modern
and simple, should all look like
old computers from the 80s-90s
